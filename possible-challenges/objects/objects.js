// Create a 'numbers' object with the following properties age, score, length, and year. Set the age property to 30, the score property to 100, the length property to 12, and the year property to 2015.

//Code Here

// Create a function called objectLooper that when called will loop through your object and change all of the values to be 20.

//Code Here



//Create an object called states that has a utah property with a value of 2942902, a texas property with a value of 26956958, and a california property with a value of 38802500.

//Code Here

//Now create a function called statesLooper that when invoked will loop through your states object and if the states value is greater than 3000000, set it to 0.

//Code Here





// Loop through an object and remove any properties whose values are falsy. Then update the object with new information.

var user = {
    name: 'Tyler McGinnis',
    email: null,
    pwHash: 'U+Ldlngx2BYQk',
    birthday: undefined,
    username: 'tylermcginnis33',
    age: 0
}

/*Above you're given a user object. Create a function called removeFalsy that loops through the user object and checks to make sure that each value is truthy. If it's not truthy, remove it from the object, then return the revised object. */

// Code Here

//Invoke the removeFalsy function. and save the result to a variable called cleanUser.

// Code Here

//Once you get your truthy object, create a function called personalize that changes the remaining values in cleanUser to be: name: 'Ryan', pwHash: '43df90w_h', username: 'ryanleeeallred'.

//A function that exists as a property of an object is called a method.
// One of the ways that this is useful is if for customizing the behavior of the function (method) with other information held in the object.

//var tyler = {
//    name: 'Tyler McGinnis',
//    age: 24,
//    pwHash: 'U+Ldlngx2BYQk',
//    email: 'tylermcginnis33@gmail.com',
//    birthday: '05/02/1990',
//    username: 'tylermcginnis33',
//    sayName: function(){
//        return 'Hello, my name is : ' + this.name;
//    },
//    sayEmail: function(){
//        return 'My email address is : ' + this.email;
//    }
//};

//Let's say I decided to change my name and email address to the following:
// name -> 'Tyler S. McGinnis', email -> 'tyler.mcginnis@devmounta.in'. Make that change.

//Code Here

//Now call the sayName method that's on the tyler object and save its response to a variable called namePhrase. Call the sayEmail method and save its response to a variable called emailPhrase.

//Code Here
