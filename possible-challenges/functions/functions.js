// If statements are all about making decisions based on certain parameters.
// Let's decide what you should wear today based on the temperature outside and the weather.
// Create a function called myOutfit that takes in a temperature and a weather parameter.
// <ul><li>If the temperature is greater than or equal to 72 and weather is "rainy" return "shorts and t-shirt, bring umbrella".
// </li><li>If the temperature is greater than or equal to 72 and the weather is "sunny" return "shorts and t-shirt".</li><li>
// If the temperature is less than 72 and the weather is "rainy" return "long pants and rain coat".
// </li><li>If the temperature is less than 72 and the weather is "sunny" return "long pants and sweater".</li>


//Create a function called evenFinder that takes an array as an argument and returns an array with all of the odd numbers removed.


// Create a function called myLoop that takes in two parameters,
// the first parameter should represent a starting number and the second is how many times the starting number should be incremented.



//Create a function called exponent that takes in two parameters,
// the first parameter should represent a number to be multiplied against itself and the second parameter should represent how many
// times it is multiplied by itself. The function should return the result of this operation. exponent(2,3) should return 8


// Write a function called 'reverse' that takes is given str as it's only argument and returns that string after it's been reversed



// Have the function exOh(str) take the str parameter being passed and return true if there is an equal number of x's and o's, otherwise return false. Only these two letters will be entered in the string, no punctuation or numbers. For example: if str is "xooxxxxooxo" then the output should return false because there are 6 x's and 5 o's.

// Have the function letterCapitalize(str) take the str parameter being passed, capitalize the first letter of each word, and return the altered string. Words will be separated by only one space.








// ARRAY + FUNCTION
// Finish the function missingNo so that it takes in a sorted array of integers which contains all integers between 0 and N except one value, and returns the missing integer in that array. Example: if you are passed [0,1,2,3,5],
// this is an array between 0 and 5, it is sorted. However, the number 4 is missing. Your function needs to return 4.





//OBJECTS + FUNCTIONS

// Create a function called getPerson. Inside that function create a person object with a name property (string) and an age property (number) and return it.

//Create a newCar function that takes in two parameters: make and model. Using those parameters create a car object with make and model properties and return it from the newCar function

// Create a function called canDrive that takes in a person object that has a name and an age property.
// If the person's age is greater than or equal to 16 then return a string concatenating their name with the string " is old enough to drive."
// If the person's age is less than 16 then return a string concatenating their name with the string " is not old enough to drive."

// Create a function called changeEmail that takes in a user object and a newEmail string.
// Replace the user's current email address (assigned to the email property) with the newEmail string, then return the updated user object.

//Create a function called addRole that takes in a user object and a string. This string will represent the user's new role in the system (i.e. admin, creator, editor, visitor).
// Create a new property on the user object called "role" and assign the passed in string to it, then return the updated user object.

// Create a function called removeRole that takes in a user object. Delete the user's role property and return the updated user.



// Create a function called unknownPerson that takes in a person object. This person object will have properties such as name, age, gender, etc. Loop through all the properties of the object and set each value to "Unknown", then return the object.
// For example, if "person" is {name: "Dolph L.", age: 33} then the function would return {name: "Unknown", age: "Unknown"}.


// Create a function called truthyObject that takes in a user object. This function should loop through the user object checking to make sure that each of its values is truthy.
// If a value is not truthy then remove it from the object. Return the updated object after looping through it.
